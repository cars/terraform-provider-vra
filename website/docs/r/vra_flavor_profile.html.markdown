# Resource: vra_flavor_profile

## Example Usages

This is an example of how to create a flavor profile resource.

**Flavor profile:**

```hcl
resource "vra_flavor_profile" "my-aws-flavor-profile" {
 name = "AWS"
 description = "My AWS flavor"
 region_id = "${data.vra_region.aws.id}"
 flavor_mapping {
  name = "small"
  instance_type = "t2.small"
 }
 flavor_mapping {
  name = "medium"
  instance_type = "t2.medium"
 }
}

resource "vra_flavor_profile" "my-vsphere-flavor-profile" {
 name = "vSphere"
 description = "My vSphere flavor"
 region_id = "${data.vra_region.vsphere.id}"
 flavor_mapping {
  name = "small"
  cpu_count = 2
  memory = 2048
 }
 flavor_mapping {
  name = "medium"
  cpu_count = 4
  memory = 4096
 }
}
```

An flavor profile resource supports the following arguments:

## Argument Reference

* `description` - (Optional) A human-friendly description.

* `name` - (Required) A human-friendly name used as an identifier in APIs that support this option.
